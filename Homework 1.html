	<p><font size="4"><center>My name is Adriana Weiss. I have been a student at Irvine Valley College for three years. When I first enrolled at IVC my major was criminal justice but last year I changed my major to web development. This class seemed interesting so I decided to take it. Along with being a student I work full time at an after school progam. Juggling school and work has been tough but it has taught me that I can get through rough times and keep going. I have had very little exprience with using HTML5 but became interested when I came across the website codeacademy.com and started to work through some of the program.</center></p>

	<p><right>I am attending this class because I have recently changed my major and I am trying to take as many classes as I can to make sure this is the field I want to be working in. Changing my major has been a tough transition but it helped me realize that I had different interest than I did when I first enrolled at IVC. I am excited to continue to work in this class, and to see how much I learn.</right></p>
